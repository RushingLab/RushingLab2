title: Long-distance dispersal
---

Immigration and emigration (collectively termed *dispersal*) are key demographic processes influencing both individual fitness and population dynamics. Many dispersal movements happen at spatial scales much larger than the boundaries of typical study areas but due to the challenges of tracking dispersing individuals, the causes and consequences of these movements are poorly understood. A primary focus of my research is developing analytical tools to study the individual- and population-level consequences of long-distance dispersal. Much of my research on long-distance dispersal has focused on using stable isotopes, particularly hydrogen, to detect long-distance dispersal movements and quantify how they influence individual fitness. More recently, my research on this topic has focused on the intersection between habitat selection, dispersal distance, and population dynamics.
