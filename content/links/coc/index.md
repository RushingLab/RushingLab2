All members of the Rushing lab are expected to behave in a manner that promotes a healthy, inclusive working environment. This includes:

> Be kind to others. Treat members of the lab as you would want to be treated.

> Keep all communication appropriate for a professional audience. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

> Do your part to create a respectful environment for everyone. Every member of this lab has something to contribute.

> Remember that your actions can inadvertently be injurious to others even if you do not intend them to be. If someone calls you out on your behavior, please listen to them, apologize, and learn from the encounter.

Discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to discrimination based on: racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion, political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, or appearance. 

Any instances of inappropriate behavior should be reported to Clark Rushing or the the appropriate authorities immediately. All communications will be treated as confidential. Any lab member that is asked to stop inappropriate behavior is expected to comply immediately. Failure to comply will result referral to the appropriate University authority.

## Sexual harassment and assualt

The University of Georgia takes issues related to sexual harassment and assault very seriously. From the UGA [non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy webpage](https://eoo.uga.edu/policies-resources/ndah-policy/):

> **Sexual Misconduct**:  An umbrella term that is used to describe a wide range of prohibited sexual conduct as described below, including sexual harassment. Sexual misconduct can occur regardless of the relationship, position or respective sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity of the parties. Same-sex harassment violates this Policy, as does harassment by a student of an employee or a subordinate employee of their supervisor.

> **Sexual Harassment** (Other than Student on Student): Unwelcome verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct, based on sex (including gender stereotypes), that may be any of the following:
    - Implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of employment or status in a course, program, or activity;
    - A basis for employment or educational decisions;
    - Is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to interfere with one’s work or educational performance creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or learning environment, or interfering with or limiting one’s ability to participate in or to benefit from an institutional program or activity; or
    - Determined by a Reasonable Person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to a University education program or activity in violation of Title IX.

For more information about how to report a sexual assault incident and resources if you have been the victim of sexual assault, please refer to the University's [Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault](https://safeandsecure.uga.edu/sexual-assault/) website.  

Please note that when reporting incidents of sexual assault or harassment, UGA [offers amnesty](https://eoo.uga.edu/policies-resources/title-ix-sex-discrimination-harassment/sexual-assault-response-protocol/) for the drug and alcohol student code violations.
