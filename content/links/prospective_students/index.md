### PhD Opportunity

A PhD position is available in the Chandler and Rushing Labs at the University of Georgia to assess how dispersal and climate change interact to affect fitness and species distributions of songbirds in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The student will design field experiments and help lead field studies of several species with trailing-edge populations in the study area, including Canada Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Veery, and several others. The four-year NSF grant includes funding for the deployment of Motus sensor stations, nodes, and tags to detect and model natal dispersal movements of focal species. More than twenty years of data on dispersal and demography are also available as part of a long-term study of the dynamics of trailing-edge populations. Applicants should have an MS degree in wildlife ecology or a related field, strong quantitative skills, and passerine field experience. Experience with deployment of Motus tags (or similar) and receivers is preferred. The anticipated start date is August 2024. Tuition will be waived and an assistantship of approximately $30,000/yr for four years will be provided. Send a single PDF including a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references to Dr. Richard Chandler (rchandler@warnell.uga.edu) and Dr. Clark Rushing (clark.rushing@uga.edu) by November 13, 2023. 

### A note on quantitative skills for prospective students

Ecology is an inherently quantitative field and it is becoming nearly impossible to be a practicing ecologist without some training in statistics and programming. The research done in my lab reflects these realities and I want all of my students to graduate with a toolbox of quantitative skills that will allow them to be successful professionals. I do not, however, require new students to arrive on campus with extensive experience in these areas. More important to me is a desire to learn quantitative skills and apply them to exciting scientific questions. At the end of the day, if you can formulate good questions and are willing to put in the time to learn how to answer them, you will be a successful scientist. So if you're interested in the types of questions that we ask in the Rushing lab but don't consider yourself a quantitative ecologist, don't hesitate to contact me about joining the lab.
