Our lab focuses on developing rigorous quantitative methods to address important questions in population ecology and conservation. Topics of particular interest include the movement, demography, and population dynamics of migratory birds, dispersal and its consequences to individuals and populations, and development of statistical models to advance ecological research. Feel free to explore this website for additional details about who we are and what we do.

Although much of my research focuses on migratory birds, Iâ€™m open to advising students with a wide range of interests related to quantitative population ecology and conservation. Interested in joining the lab? Please read over the information for prospective students and my mentoring philosophy.
