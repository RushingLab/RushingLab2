I’m a Research Professional in the Rushing Avian Ecology Lab and Nibbelink Spatial Ecology Lab at UGA, where I’m involved with several projects examining avian (and non-avian) habitat use and movement patterns. I’m originally from Atlanta, GA. I received my BA from Stanford and MS from Auburn before returning to Georgia to complete my PhD in Integrative Conservation and Forestry and Natural Resources at UGA. My PhD research examined patterns of habitat use in a suite of bird species in Costa Rica to inform reforestation planning.
