I am a M.S. student, studying Painted Bunting movement ecology and resource use on Little Saint Simons Island, Georgia. I grew up in Augusta, Georgia and later attended the University of Georgia to study Ecology and Studio Art. Since graduating, I worked as the Bird Technician on Little Saint Simons Island, monitoring breeding shorebird and seabird populations, and worked as a Marine Education Fellow with UGA Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant. By tracking Painted Bunting movement on Little Saint Simons Island, I hope to better understand how individuals select foraging and nesting sites and how these choices may affect their full breeding cycle.
