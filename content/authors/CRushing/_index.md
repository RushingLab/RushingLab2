I am a population ecologist with an emphasis on quantifying demographic processes and their influences on individuals, populations, and species. My research focuses primarily on the ecology and conservation of migratory birds, with projects falling within three major themes: 1) Development of full-annual-cycle models to quantify seasonal vital rates and their influence on population dynamics; 2) Demographic consequences of climate change and incorporating climate change into on conservation planning for migratory birds; and 3) Quantifying the influence of long-distance dispersal on individuals and populations. To address these issues, my research combines observational and experimental fieldwork with quantitative modeling and stable isotope analysis. You can learn more about research done in my lab or by looking over my {{< staticref "media/RushingCV.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}}.

Although my personal research focuses heavily on migratory birds, my interests are wide-ranging and Iâ€™m open to advising students working on a variety of questions related to quantitative population ecology and conservation.
