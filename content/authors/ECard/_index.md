I am a Ph.D. student studying the movement ecology and habitat use of Pinyon Jays in response to pi√±on-juniper woodland treatments in Utah and Nevada. I grew up in St. Clair, Michigan and received a B.S. in Zoology from Michigan State University. I worked as a wildlife technician for the next three years on several projects focusing on the conservation of grassland and wintering marsh birds. I earned my M.S. degree from Sul Ross State University while studying the responses of non-breeding grassland bird communities to woody plant removal in West Texas.
