I grew up in Watkinsville, Georgia, where I became interested in birds when I was six years old. My passion for birds and wildlife led me to pursue a B.S. in Ecology at the University of Georgia, which I plan to complete in the spring of 2023. During the summer of 2022, I will be studying the breeding Ecology of Painted Buntings on Little St. Simonâ€™s Island, GA. My research will be part of an ongoing study led by Dr. Rushing aimed at understanding the entire annual cycle of Painted Buntings. Specifically, I will be studying the influence of multiple environmental factors on bunting breeding success. After finishing undergrad, I plan to apply to several graduate study programs with a plan study neotropical migrants on their wintering grounds.
