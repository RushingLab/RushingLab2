I am an undergraduate student in the Warnell School of Forestry where I am majoring in Fisheries and Wildlife with an emphasis in Wildlife Sciences. I worked as a research technician helping with the study of the habitat use and movements of Chuck-willâ€™s-widows on the Georgia coastline. I have loved working with these birds and hope to continue working with birds for my senior thesis. I first fell in love with birds while interning at White Oak Conservation Center, where I had the opportunity to work with a variety of different species, including Curassows, Cranes, Double-wattled Cassowaries, and Florida Grasshopper Sparrows.
