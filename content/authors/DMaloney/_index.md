The majority of my work has focused on Golden Eagle demography across western Utah.  I’ve been with Hawkwatch International since 2014 and am currently a research associate with the non-profit raptor research organization, in addition to being a PhD student in Dr. Rushing’s population ecology lab.  My current research focuses on how environmental factors impact Golden Eagle nestling productivity and post-fledge survival.  This research is a collaboration between Dr. Rushing, Robert Knight of Dugway Proving Ground, Dr. Slater of Hawkwatch International, and myself.
