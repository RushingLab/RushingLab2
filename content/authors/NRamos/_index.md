I’m a master’s student studying nesting ecology, habitat use, and movement of Chuck-will’s-widow in coastal Georgia. I grew up in Miami, across the street from Everglades National Park, and being so close to this natural resource piqued my interest in wildlife.

 

I graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and Natural Resources, with a wildlife emphasis. After becoming involved in a hydrology research campaign on Little St. Simons Island, a migratory stop for many birds, I fell in love with the island and made the decision to pursue research there for my master’s.
