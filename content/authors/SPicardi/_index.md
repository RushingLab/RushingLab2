I am a postdoctoral researcher working on habitat and population modeling of sage-grouse in Utah and beyond. Specifically, my current research focuses on quantifying the effect of management actions, such as vegetation treatments and translocation, on sage-grouse habitat selection and demography. My main field of expertise is movement ecology, but I like to dabble in different applications of ecological models. I am also interested in reproducible science and effective practices for teaching programming. I earned my PhD at the University of Florida in 2019 with a project on the movement ecology of wood storks in the southeastern U.S. Before that, I graduated with a MSc from the University of Rome, La Sapienza in Italy, where I was born and raised.
