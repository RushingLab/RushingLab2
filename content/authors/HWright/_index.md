I am a Ph.D. student focusing on Pinyon Jay habitat use and movement ecology in Utah and New Mexico. I grew up in Tuscaloosa, Alabama where I received a B.S. in Biology from the University of Alabama. After graduating I worked with avian conservation through Americorps and the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as a wildlife technician focusing on endangered avian monitoring and research projects. I returned to academia in 2019 to earn my M.S. degree at Mississippi State University focusing on human-wildlife conflict of woodpecker cavity excavation in wooden utility structures throughout the southeastern United States.
