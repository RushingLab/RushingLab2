I am a PhD student studying the intersection of population ecology, carryover effects, and molt in Painted Buntings. I am originally from Virginia, where I graduated from the College of William and Mary in 2019. After graduating, I worked as a technician assisting with research on a variety of species, including grassland birds, woodpeckers, toads, cottontails, and mule deer. I completed my MS at Utah State University in 2023, where I studied how competition drives space use in mule deer.
